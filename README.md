I have written my code using selenium java for automation following scenarios:
1. open the url https://www.tendable.com/: 
2. Confirm accessibility of the top-level menus: Home, Our Story, Our Solution, and Why Tendable . 
3. Verify that the "Request a Demo" button is present and active on each of the aforementioned top-level menu pages. 
4. Navigate to the "Contact Us" section, choose "Marketing", and complete the formâ€” excluding the "Message" field. On submission, an error should arise. Ensure your script confirms the error message's appearance. If the error is displayed, mark the test as PASS. If absent, it's a FAIL.
